# Cybersecurity Internship – Web Application Security Implementation

## Overview

This project was completed as part of a cybersecurity internship focused on identifying and mitigating common web application vulnerabilities.
A Node.js-based user management system was analyzed, secured, and enhanced using modern security best practices.

## Security Assessment (Week 1)

* Tested for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection
* Reviewed authentication handling and password storage
* Identified missing security headers and misconfigurations

## Security Implementation (Week 2)

* Input validation and sanitization applied
* Password hashing implemented using secure algorithms
* Token-based authentication added for session security
* HTTP security headers configured

## Advanced Security Enhancements (Week 3–4)

* Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks
* CORS policy enforcement
* Content Security Policy (CSP) and HSTS protection
* API-key-based authorization for secure endpoints
* Logging and monitoring for suspicious activity

## Outcome

A hardened web application capable of resisting common web attacks and aligned with modern cybersecurity defensive practices.

## Technologies Used

Node.js, Express.js, Helmet, JWT, bcrypt, Rate Limiting, CORS, Logging, OWASP Security Concepts
